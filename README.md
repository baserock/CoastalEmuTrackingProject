# CoastalEmuTrackingProject
To track and monitor the activities of the endangered eastern coast of Australia Emu. Population &lt;100. 

This project is to track, record and analyse the coastal emu.
This project will require several different platforms to work together.
These platforms will be:
Website
database
x32/x64
android
apple

The purpose of this division is to create a single point of collection and 
a single point of dissemination.
The intention is to build these programs on 'free tier' resources as 
this project does not have any funding.

More detailed goals for these programs are:

1. Provide a website that will allow:
    a. log sighting of coastal emu
        i. Reporting name, striping of metadata from photos, location, time,
        male or female (later facial recognition), sound recording of calls, numbers, 
        direction heading, additional notes.
    b. all available information on coastal emus
    c. how to get in touch and what you can do with your local group of volunteers.

2. Build a database/log collector on amazon to collect emu sighting data.
   
3. Provide a computer based (x32/x64) application that will allow:
    a. log sighting of coastal emu
        i. Reporting name, striping of metadata from photos, location, time,
        male or female (later facial recognition), sound recording of calls, numbers, 
        direction heading, additional notes.
    b. all available information on coastal emus
    c. how to get in touch and what you can do with your local group of volunteers.
    d. interaction with website to analyse photos for facial and/or voice recognition.

        male or female (later facial recognition), sound recording of calls, numbers, 
        direction heading, additional notes.
